Algorithmic Complexity - Makers
===============================

------

This is about how algorithms scale

Splitting a sorted array, and splitting, and splitting, etc is more efficient than checking every element

<!-- first pic from pad -->

<!-- second pic -->

These are classes of complexity

How fast is linear vs binary for input size

<!-- first grab HERE... -->

------

###Â Sorting algorithm

1. Selection sort

Go through each element to get minimum and put it in new array
<!-- grab 2 -->

8 steps for every pass through
<!-- grab 3 -->


But doubling the size of array quadruples number of steps
- becomes 16 in array with 16 steps for each element
- this is the quadratic curve
- complexity class is O(n 'squared') as per pic
- way worse than linear
<!-- grab 3 -->


------

2. Insertion sort

Is the last element smaller or bigger than the next last element?
- Put them in new array in that order
- Is the ext element smaller or bigger than the first in the new array?
- If bigger, is it smaller or bigger than the next?
- If smaller move next along and insert in order...
<!-- grab 4 -->


For each element code has to compare and move if necessary for all elements in new array
<!-- grab 5 -->

- more elements mean bigger triangle of still 4x original (quadratic)
<!-- grab 6 -->

may be better than insertion, nut still O(n 'squared')
<!-- grab 7 -->


------

So, what is strategy that makes binary serach so fast?
- "Divide & conquer"
- breaking problem down into smaller and smaller problems

<!-- grab 8 -->

`solve` lines use recursion
- merging 2 smaller solved problems into a bigger solution


What is 'trivial'?
<!-- grab 9 -->

How do we break down the input?
<!-- grab 10 -->

How merge solutions?

How write something linear to merge these 2 sorted arrays?
<!-- grab 11 -->

- 2 decks of cards, just looking at the top one of each to find smallest then add to new array


This is `merge sort`


------

3. Merge sort
<!-- grab 12 -->

2 log (n) big o n log n


------

4. Quick sort

- In its worst case it can be quadratic, if array is sorted to start with (for example)
- At its best case, it is the fastest!
