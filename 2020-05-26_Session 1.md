Algorithmic Complexity - Makers

------

This is about how algorithms scale

Splitting a sorted array, and splitting, and splitting, etc is more efficient than checking every element

These are classes of complexity

How fast is linear vs binary for input size

###Â Sorting algorithm

1. Selection sort

Go through each element to get minimum and put it in new array
![image 2](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%202.png)

8 steps for every pass through


But doubling the size of array quadruples number of steps
- becomes 16 in array with 16 steps for each element
- this is the quadratic curve
- complexity class is O(n^2) as per pic
- way worse than linear

------

2. Insertion sort

Is the last element smaller or bigger than the next last element?
- Put them in new array in that order
- Is the ext element smaller or bigger than the first in the new array?
- If bigger, is it smaller or bigger than the next?
- If smaller move next along and insert in order...

For each element code has to compare and move if necessary for all elements in new array

- more elements mean bigger triangle of still 4x original (quadratic)
![image 6](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%206.png)

may be better than insertion, nut still O(n^2)

------

So, what is strategy that makes binary search so fast?
- "Divide & conquer"
- breaking problem down into smaller and smaller problems

![image 8](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%208.png)

`solve` lines use recursion
- merging 2 smaller solved problems into a bigger solution


What is 'trivial'?

How do we break down the input?
![image 10](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%2010.png)

How merge solutions?

How write something linear to merge these 2 sorted arrays?
![image 11](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%2011.png)

- 2 decks of cards, just looking at the top one of each to find smallest then add to new array


This is `merge sort`


------

3. Merge sort
![image 12](https://github.com/mattTea/algorithmic-complexity-course/blob/master/images/grab%2012.png)

2 log(n) or `O(n log n)`


------

4. Quick sort

- In its worst case it can be quadratic, if array is sorted to start with (for example)
- At its best case, it is the fastest!
